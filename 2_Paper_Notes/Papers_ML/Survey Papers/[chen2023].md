## Abstract
"In real-world express systems, couriers need to satisfy not only the delivery demands but also the pick-up demands of customers. Delivery and pickup tasks are usually mixed together within integrated routing plans. Such a mixed routing problem can be abstracted and formulated as Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Delivery and Pickup (VRPMDP), which is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To solve VRPMDP, there are three major challenges as below. (a) Even though successive pickup and delivery tasks are independent to accomplish, the inter-influence between choosing pickup task or delivery task to deal with still exists. (b) Due to the two-way flow of goods between the depot and customers, the loading rate of vehicles leaving the depot affects routing decisions. (c) The proportion of deliveries and pickups will change due to the complex demand situation in real-world scenarios, which requires robustness of the algorithm. To solve the challenges above, we design an encoder-decoder based framework to generate high-quality and robust VRPMDP solutions. First, we consider a VRPMDP instance as a graph and utilize a GNN encoder to extract the feature of the instance effectively. The detailed routing solutions are further decoded as a sequence by the decoder with attention mechanism. Second, we propose a Coordinated Decision of Loading and Routing (CDLR) mechanism to determine the loading rate dynamically after the vehicle returns to the depot, thus avoiding the influence of improper loading rate settings. Finally, the model equipped with a GNN encoder and CDLR simultaneously can adapt to the changes in the proportion of deliveries and pickups. We conduct the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The experiments show that our method achieves desirable results and generalization ability."

## Summary
- **Problem & Motivation**
  - Addresses real-world express systems that must handle both deliveries (outbound) and pickups (inbound) in a single routing plan.  
  - This is formulated as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Deliveries and Pickups (VRPMDP), a deterministic combinatorial optimization problem.  
  - Traditional heuristics (ant colony, tabu search, adaptive large neighborhood search) can be time-consuming for large-scale problems. A faster, more adaptable approach is required.

- **ML Model & Approach**
  - Proposes a **deep reinforcement learning** solution with an **encoder-decoder** architecture.
    - **Encoder**: A **graph neural network (GNN)** that represents each problem instance as a graph (fully connected or near-fully connected). Node features include coordinates and demand type (delivery vs. pickup).
    - **Decoder**: An **attention-based** sequence generator (similar to Pointer Networks) that produces the route step by step.
    - The method uses a **policy gradient** algorithm (REINFORCE with rollout baseline) to train the model end-to-end.
  - Key innovation: **Coordinated Decision of Loading and Routing (CDLR)**. Instead of fixing how much outbound parcel capacity to load at the depot, the method dynamically updates the allowed loading rate range. The actual loading rate is then determined each time the vehicle returns to the depot.  
    - Prevents early lock-in on a suboptimal capacity usage strategy.  
    - Enhances flexibility to handle changing proportions of pickup vs. delivery demands.

- **VRP Variant**
  - VRPMDP with a single vehicle capacity constraint.  
  - Each customer has either a delivery or a pickup request (single demand type per customer).  
  - Objective: minimize total travel distance while serving both types of requests.

- **Methodology Highlights**
  1. **Formulating the State**: Includes partial route, unvisited customers, and the evolving capacity status (both deliveries loaded and pickups onboard).  
  2. **GNN-based Encoder**: Learns node embeddings capturing connectivity and demand features. Outputs both per-node and global (average-pooled) graph embeddings.  
  3. **Decoder with Attention**:  
     - Computes context vectors from last visited node embedding + vehicle’s current load state + global graph embedding.  
     - Uses multi-head attention to refine context, then single-head attention to produce a probability distribution over unvisited nodes.  
     - A masking mechanism ensures capacity feasibility, guided by the CDLR logic.
  4. **CDLR Mechanism**: Maintains and updates feasible ranges for the loading rate. Once the vehicle is forced back to the depot or finishes a sub-route, the final loading rate for that sub-route is fixed. This step helps adapt to the proportion of pickup vs. delivery dynamically.

- **Experimental Results**
  - Conducted on two sets:
    1. **Randomly generated** VRPMDP instances (n = 20, 50, 100).
    2. **Real-world dataset**: Derived from 226 delivery and 226 pickup requests in Guangdong Province, China (various subsets for scale).
  - Compared against:
    - Classical heuristics: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO).  
    - Other RL-based VRP solvers adapted to mixed pickup/delivery: AM-VRP, MDAM-VRP, E-GAT-VRP (all with a fixed loading rate).  
  - **Key Findings**:  
    - Proposed method yields shorter routes (distance) than all baselines, often by notable margins (improvements up to ~10-25% over certain heuristics or prior RL solutions).  
    - Inference speed is competitive, far faster than heuristics for large instances.  
    - Displays **robust generalization** to changing delivery/pickup ratios, outperforming baselines that assume a fixed loading rate.  
    - Demonstrates some transferability to larger problem sizes (though best if the training and inference set sizes are similar).

- **Strengths & Contributions**
  - **Novelty** of combining GNN, attention-based decoder, and a dynamic capacity assignment (CDLR) for VRPMDP.  
  - Demonstrates **strong solution quality** and **fast inference** once trained.  
  - Substantial improvement in **robustness** compared to methods with a fixed loading strategy.  
  - Includes tests on **real-world data** (not merely synthetic), showing practical feasibility.

- **Limitations & Open Issues**
  - Does not use standard VRP benchmark sets like Solomon or Christofides; uses only a custom real-world dataset and random instances.  
  - Focuses on single-vehicle scenarios, though extension to multiple vehicles may require additional design.  
  - Trained model generalizes across certain size ranges but still sees performance drop when extrapolating to much larger instance sizes.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP & Potential Impact**
  - Well-aligned with deterministic VRP research: no uncertainty in demands, times, or travel distances.  
  - Illustrates how **policy-gradient-based RL** can address a realistic extension of VRP that merges delivery and pickup.  
  - Highlights the importance of **dynamic capacity decisions** (loading rate) for improved solutions in tasks that combine inbound and outbound logistics.  
  - Strengthens the case for **hybrid GNN + attention** architectures in VRP contexts.
