## Abstract
"This paper presents an approach to learn the local-search heuristics that iteratively improves the solution of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). A local-search heuristics is composed of a destroy operator that destructs a candidate solution, and a following repair operator that rebuilds the destructed one into a new one. The proposed neural network, as trained through actor-critic framework, consists of an encoder in form of a modified version of Graph Attention Network where node embeddings and edge embeddings are integrated, and a GRU-based decoder rendering a pair of destroy and repair operators. Experiment results show that it outperforms both the traditional heuristics algorithms and the existing neural combinatorial optimization for VRP on medium-scale data set, and is able to tackle the large-scale data set (e.g., over 400 nodes) which is a considerable challenge in this area. Moreover, the need for expertise and handcrafted heuristics design is eliminated due to the fact that the proposed network learns to design the heuristics with a better performance. Our implementation is available online."

## Summary
- **Problem & Motivation**
  - Addresses the challenge of designing destroy-and-repair heuristics for the deterministic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in an automated way.
  - Targets Capacitated VRP (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW), aiming to improve solution quality and computational scalability.

- **Core Contribution**
  - Proposes a novel end-to-end approach to learn both **destroy** and **repair** operators within a large neighborhood search framework.
  - Eliminates the need for handcrafting heuristics: the network automatically learns to select nodes to remove (destroy) and the order in which to re-insert them (repair).
  - Demonstrates superior performance over classical heuristic methods (ALNS, SISR) and previous neural combinatorial optimization approaches.

- **Methodology**
  - **Encoder**:  
    - Introduces **EGATE (Element-wise Graph Attention Network)**, a variant of the GAT architecture that incorporates both node-level and edge-level embeddings.  
    - Stacks multiple EGATE layers, enabling long-range information propagation in the graph.  
    - Produces enriched node embeddings that combine demand, service windows, route usage, and distance/cost features.
  - **Decoder**:  
    - Uses a GRU-based pointer network approach to select which nodes to remove and the order for reinsertion.  
    - Each step selects a node based on an attention mechanism over all current node embeddings, yielding a probability distribution for node selection.
  - **Training**:  
    - Uses a **reinforcement learning** approach (actor-critic with **PPO**) to update the model parameters.  
    - Reward function is the difference in VRP cost (distance plus vehicle usage cost) between consecutive iterations.  
    - Applies simulated annealing acceptance criteria during the iterative improvement to balance exploration vs. exploitation.

- **Experiments**
  - **Data Generation**: random instances with up to 100 nodes for CVRP and CVRPTW in medium-scale tests, and up to 400 nodes for large-scale tests.
  - **Comparisons**:
    - Baselines: Random removal, ALNS, SISR, and an Attention Model (AM) baseline from prior literature.
    - Measures: average route cost over multiple random instances, convergence rate to near-optimal solutions.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - On 100-node CVRP and CVRPTW, the proposed EGATE-based model converges faster and achieves lower total cost than baselines under the same iteration limits.
    - The approach handles 400-node problems more effectively than classical heuristics, reducing the gap to a near-optimal benchmark.
    - Shows that batching (evaluating multiple repair/destroy sequences in parallel) can further improve solution quality.

- **Key Results & Findings**
  - Demonstrates how integrating edge embeddings in the attention mechanism yields stronger expressiveness for route constraints and cost factors.
  - Learns generalized heuristics: the modelâ€™s policy can adapt to different VRP settings without reengineering new operators.
  - Scales to problems with 400+ nodes, addressing a known limitation of many neural methods in combinatorial optimization.

- **Strengths**
  - Eliminates reliance on human expert knowledge for designing local search moves.
  - Provides a unified approach for both CVRP and CVRPTW, illustrating flexibility with time window constraints.
  - Demonstrates competitive or better performance than popular heuristic methods (SISR, ALNS) within fewer iterations.

- **Weaknesses & Limitations**
  - Requires a relatively large training budget, especially for bigger instances.
  - Relies on domain knowledge for embedding design (e.g., route-based features) and may need careful feature normalization.
  - Uses random-instance training, which may require retraining or fine-tuning for real-world distributions with more nuanced constraints.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP Research**
  - Highly relevant: focuses on CVRP/CVRPTW, addresses performance and scalability, proposes an integrated ML-based local search strategy.
  - Illustrates a blueprint for merging reinforcement learning with large-neighborhood search heuristics in a deterministic VRP framework.

- **Potential Impact & Future Work**
  - Encourages broader application of learned heuristics beyond VRP to other routing or scheduling problems with similar structure.
  - Suggests that attention-based GNNs can handle large graphs effectively if combined with masking strategies and deeper receptive fields.
  - Opens further exploration into dynamic or multi-objective constraints, though the current paper focuses strictly on deterministic conditions.
