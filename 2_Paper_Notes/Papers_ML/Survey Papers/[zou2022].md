## Abstract
"Low-carbon logistics is an emerging and sustainable development industry in the era of a low-carbon economy. The end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method with an encoder-decoder framework has been proven effective for solving logistics problems. However, in most cases, the recurrent neural networks (RNN) and attention mechanisms are used in encoders and decoders, which may result in the long-distance dependence problem and the neglect of the correlation between query vectors. To surround this problem, we propose an improved transformer model (TAOA) with both multi-head attention mechanism (MHA) and attention to attention mechanism (AOA), and apply it to solve the low-carbon multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP). In this model, the MHA and AOA are implemented to solve the probability of route nodes in the encoder and decoder. The MHA is used to process different parts of the input sequence, which can be calculated in parallel, and the AOA is used to deal with the deficiency problem of correlation between query results and query vectors in the MHA. The actor-critic framework based on strategy gradient is constructed to train model parameters. The 2opt operator is further used to optimize the resulting routes. Finally, extensive numerical studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness and operation efficiency of the proposed TAOA, and the results show that the proposed TAOA performs better in solving the MDVRP than the traditional transformer model (Kools), genetic algorithm (GA), and Google OR-Tools (Ortools)."

## Summary
- **Problem & Motivation**  
  - Addresses a **low-carbon multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP)** with fuel consumption and carbon emissions included in the objective.  
  - Seeks to reduce both travel cost and environmental impact by incorporating energy-based metrics (fuel consumption & carbon emissions).

- **Main Contribution**  
  - Develops a **transformer-based deep reinforcement learning** method called **TAOA (Transformer with Attention to Attention)**.  
  - Integrates two major enhancements over a standard transformer approach:  
    1. **Multi-Head Attention (MHA)** in the encoder and decoder for richer feature extraction.  
    2. **Attention to Attention (AOA)** to mitigate the limitation where standard attention can ignore the direct correlation between query vectors and query results.  
  - Uses an **Actor-Critic** reinforcement learning framework to train the model, allowing policy gradient updates in an end-to-end fashion.  
  - Employs a **2-opt local search** post-processing step to further refine routing solutions.

- **Methodology & ML Approach**  
  - The paper proposes a **deterministic, end-to-end RL** approach:  
    - **Encoder** (Transformer) encodes the depot/customer features along with demands.  
    - **Decoder** selects the next node to visit via a learned probability distribution, guided by multi-head attention and augmented by AOA.  
    - An **actor-critic** algorithm (advantage actor-critic, A2C variant) is used to train network weights.  
    - A **masking** strategy prevents revisiting served customers.  
    - **2-opt** local search is used after the transformer-based route generation to remove suboptimal edges.

- **VRP Variant**  
  - Focuses on a **multi-depot VRP** with capacity constraints, plus explicit modeling of **fuel and carbon emissions**.  
  - Cost includes vehicle usage, distance traveled, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions.  
  - Problem scale tested goes up to 100 customers, indicating a modestly **large-scale** scenario.

- **Key Findings / Experimental Results**  
  - **TAOA** outperforms:  
    - A baseline **transformer approach** (Kools)  
    - A **Genetic Algorithm** (GA)  
    - **Google OR-Tools** solver.  
  - Incorporating AOA significantly improves solution quality.  
  - Local search (2-opt) can reduce total cost further by a noticeable margin.  
  - The proposed model is shown to converge in about 20 epochs of training.  
  - While run times slightly exceed standard solvers like OR-Tools, the approach scales better compared to more computationally expensive methods (like a naive GA) and yields better cost solutions in many instances.

- **Strengths**  
  - Demonstrates how **attention-to-attention** can enhance the transformer’s decoding precision for routing tasks.  
  - Combines **RL** with a **local search** heuristic, showcasing hybrid optimization potential.  
  - Thorough set of random instance experiments highlight consistent performance gains.  
  - Explicitly addresses **low-carbon objectives**, an important topic for sustainable logistics.

- **Limitations**  
  - Benchmarks are **randomly generated** data, so it is difficult to compare with known standard VRP instances.  
  - The approach requires time-consuming offline training, although inference is relatively fast afterward.  
  - Potentially high memory usage due to the transformer’s architecture for large-scale VRPs beyond 100 nodes.

- **Relevance to Thesis**  
  - Illustrates a **deterministic** RL-based approach for a **multi-depot** and **green** VRP variant.  
  - Adds insight into advanced **transformer architectures** for combinatorial optimization.  
  - Demonstrates the synergy of **actor-critic RL** with **local search** refinements.  
  - Showcases a method for tackling **fuel and emission** constraints, broadening the VRP to include environmental objectives.
