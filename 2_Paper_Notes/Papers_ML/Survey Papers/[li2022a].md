## Abstract
"Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) intrinsically cope with homogeneous vehicle fleet, in which the fleet is assumed as repetitions of a single vehicle. Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection of the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle. However, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with different characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed), rendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this paper, we tackle heterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by different capacities. We consider both min-max and min-sum objectives for HCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s) in the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the attention mechanism with a vehicle selection decoder accounting for the heterogeneous fleet constraint and a node selection decoder accounting for the route construction, which learns to construct a solution by automatically selecting both a vehicle and a node for this vehicle at each step. Experimental results based on randomly generated instances show that, with desirable generalization to various problem sizes, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DRL method and most of the conventional heuristics, and also delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art heuristic method, i.e., SISR. Additionally, the results of extended experiments demonstrate that our method is also able to solve CVRPLib instances with satisfactory performance."

## Summary
- **Problem & Motivation**  
  - Addresses the Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (HCVRP), departing from prior DRL works which only handle homogeneous fleets.  
  - Considers both min-max (fairness-based, minimizing the longest travel time among vehicles) and min-sum (minimize the total travel time) objectives.  
  - Recognizes that real-world fleets often have vehicles with different capacities or speeds, requiring explicit vehicle selection decisions rather than merely repeating a single-vehicle route construction.

- **Approach & Methodology**  
  - Proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates an attention-based encoder-decoder for solution construction.  
  - Uses a **Transformer-style encoder** to embed the instance data (locations, demands, capacities) into feature vectors.  
  - Introduces two decoders:
    1. **Vehicle Selection Decoder**: Chooses which vehicle to dispatch next, using capacity/travel-time states of all vehicles.  
    2. **Node Selection Decoder**: Selects the customer node for the chosen vehicle to visit.  
  - Adopts a policy gradient training procedure with a baseline network to reduce variance and guide learning.  
  - During training, random instances are generated on-the-fly. During inference, the model can act greedily or sample multiple solutions for improved quality.

- **Key Contributions & Findings**  
  - Shows that explicitly modeling vehicle selection significantly boosts solution quality for heterogeneous fleets, in contrast to homogeneous assumptions in typical DRL-based CVRP.  
  - Demonstrates strong generalization to larger problem sizes and a variety of instance configurations (e.g., 40-160 customers, 3 or 5 vehicles).  
  - Achieves:
    - Faster runtime compared to advanced classical heuristics like Slack Induction by String Removals (SISR) for large-scale instances under time-limited settings.  
    - Competitive or superior performance against established methods (VNS, ACO, FA) and a strong DRL baseline (attention model “AM”) in terms of route quality.  
  - Extends evaluation to standard CVRPLib instances, revealing that the model generalizes better on uniformly distributed instances but remains reasonably competitive on non-uniform distributions.

- **Experiments & Performance**  
  - Evaluates on random instances (up to 160 customers) and CVRPLib.  
  - Compares with:  
    - Conventional heuristics (SISR, VNS, ACO, Firefly Algorithm)  
    - Another DRL approach (Attention Model, “AM”)  
    - Generic exact solver for smaller min-sum variants  
  - Reports solution quality (max/mean travel time, total travel time) and computational time.  
  - Shows strong performance in solution quality, with significantly lower or comparable computing time than advanced heuristics.  
  - Demonstrates that a sampling-based inference policy outperforms a greedy one, at the cost of slightly higher runtime but still far below classical heuristics.

- **Strengths**  
  - Novel approach to incorporate explicit fleet heterogeneity into a DRL-based construction method.  
  - Flexible two-decoder architecture, decoupling “which vehicle to use” from “which node to serve.”  
  - Effective generalization to larger instance sizes and new problem sets (e.g., partial coverage of CVRPLib).  
  - Achieves near state-of-the-art solutions with drastically reduced computation time compared to classical metaheuristics or exact methods on large-scale problems.

- **Limitations & Future Work**  
  - Performance drops on instances with location distributions different from the training distribution (e.g., some non-uniform CVRPLib sets).  
  - Heterogeneity is chiefly modeled via capacity differences and speed variations, but other real-world complexities (time windows, dynamic demands) remain unaddressed.  
  - Potential to extend approach for further constraints (e.g., time windows, multi-depot VRP) or dynamic settings.  
  - Future directions: incorporate local search improvements (active search, large neighborhood search) or advanced sampling strategies to refine solutions.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP**  
  - The work is fully deterministic, focusing on a static scenario.  
  - Demonstrates a state-of-the-art DRL framework well aligned with the thesis objective of summarizing ML-based methods for deterministic VRPs.  
  - Provides insight on how to handle a more realistic scenario (heterogeneous fleets) within purely deterministic constraints.
