## Abstract
"We demonstrate the use of Ant Colony System (ACS) to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem associated with collection of recycling waste from households, treated as nodes in a spatial network. For networks where the nodes are concentrated in separate clusters, the use of k-means clustering can greatly improve the efficiency of the solution. The ACS algorithm is extended to model the use of multicompartment vehicles with kerbside sorting of waste into separate compartments for glass, paper, etc. The algorithm produces high-quality solutions for two-compartment test problems."

## Summary
- **Problem & Motivation**  
  - Focuses on a **deterministic capacitated VRP** variant for municipal waste collection, where routes must be planned for vehicles collecting different recyclable materials.  
  - Introduces **multi-compartment** vehicles (each compartment has its own capacity) to keep different waste types separate from pickup.  
  - Aims to reduce total cost and routing inefficiencies while respecting compartment capacities.

- **Key Contributions**  
  1. **Ant Colony System (ACS) algorithm extension**: Incorporates a mechanism for multiple unloading trips whenever a compartment hits capacity.  
  2. **Multi-Compartment Vehicle Routing**: Extends the single-compartment ACS approach to handle separate capacities for each waste category (e.g., paper, glass), ensuring no compartment exceeds its limit.  
  3. **Clustering approach**: Uses k-means clustering to divide the node set, then solves each cluster’s sub-problem separately. This “cluster-first, route-second” approach is shown to reduce computational time significantly, particularly in structured (clustered) instances.  
  4. **Local Search (2-opt)**: After the ant-generated routes, applies 2-opt improvement to sub-tours to further reduce route length.

- **Methodology**  
  - **Ant Colony Construction**:  
    - Places one ant per customer node.  
    - Each ant builds a route step by step, selecting the next feasible node based on a stochastic rule favoring arcs with high pheromone levels and short distance (the standard ACS “pseudo-random proportional rule”).  
    - If the vehicle load (for any compartment) would exceed capacity upon visiting the next node, the ant is forced to return to the depot and reset compartment loads to zero.  
    - After a full traversal, a global pheromone update rewards the best solution found so far.  
  - **Multi-Compartment Extension**:  
    - Tracks separate loads for each compartment.  
    - Checks capacity constraints individually for each compartment. If any single compartment would overflow, an unloading trip is triggered.  
    - Uses the same ACS update scheme but on a 3D structure of [ant, step, compartment] for load tracking.  
  - **Clustering**:  
    - Applies k-means based on geographical coordinates to create K clusters (where K is derived from total demand and vehicle capacity).  
    - Uses a “load-balancing” step to swap nodes between clusters if a cluster’s total demand is too large for a single vehicle.  
    - Runs the ACS + 2-opt on each cluster independently, merging the sub-solutions for a final global solution.  

- **Experiments**  
  - Tested on multiple Christofides benchmark sets (C1, C2, C3, C11, C12).  
  - Demonstrates that for unstructured instances (where nodes are randomly placed), pure ACS (without clustering) can match or nearly match best-known solutions for smaller problems. For larger problems, results are within a modest gap of known optima.  
  - In structured/clustered instances (like C12), applying k-means drastically improves both solution quality and runtime compared to a monolithic ACS approach.  
  - Shows that **two-compartment** variants of the C1 benchmark can be solved effectively with the same number of ACS iterations, achieving near-optimal routes (within ~7% of single-compartment best-known solutions).

- **Findings & Conclusions**  
  - **Feasibility**: The proposed ACS extension handles the capacity constraints of multi-compartment vehicles effectively without slowing convergence.  
  - **Clustering Gains**: For networks with natural clusters, “cluster-first, route-second” significantly boosts solution quality and reduces compute time. For unstructured networks, clustering might be less beneficial.  
  - **Route Quality**: Even in multi-compartment scenarios, final solutions often fill compartments to near capacity, demonstrating the algorithm’s ability to minimize the number of total sub-tours.  
  - **Limitations**:  
    - For very large VRPs, the number of iterations or computing time may become extensive.  
    - K-means clustering does not account for demands directly in the initial assignment, so a load-balancing step is needed.  
  - **Relevance to Deterministic VRP**: The entire approach assumes known deterministic demands; no stochastic or dynamic elements are involved. The method thus fits well within classical deterministic VRP research.

- **Relevance to the Thesis**  
  - Illustrates how **swarm-intelligence-based heuristics** like ACS can be extended to handle specialized constraints (multi-compartment).  
  - Shows a **cluster-first, route-second** pipeline using ML-based clustering (k-means), which can serve as a pre-processing technique in deterministic VRP.  
  - Demonstrates that a local search (2-opt) post-processing is integral for improving metaheuristic solutions.  
  - Confirms the viability of multi-compartment capacity constraints under purely deterministic assumptions.
