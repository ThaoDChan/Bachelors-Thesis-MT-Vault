## Abstract
"Vehicle routing is an important task of the modern transportation service provider. Optimizing vehicle routes not only can significantly reduce operational costs but also increase customer satisfaction. However, the vehicle routing problem is known as NP-hard and it is still challenging to efficiently solve the large-size problems in real delivery systems. In this paper, rather than designing heuristics, we propose a novel deep learning model to learn a heuristic-like policy that generates the vehicle routing schedule.

Our model is based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) with node feature (coordination and demand) and edge feature (the real distance between nodes) as input and embedded. Separate decoders are proposed to decode the representations of these two features. The output of one decoder is the supervision of the other decoder. We propose a strategy that combines the reinforcement learning manner with the supervised learning manner to train the model. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world data, we show that 1) the edge feature is important to be explicitly considered in the model; 2) the joint learning strategy can accelerate the convergence of the training and improve the solution quality; 3) our model significantly outperforms several well-known algorithms in the literature, especially when the problem size is large; 3) our method is generalized beyond the size of problem instances they were trained on."

## Summary
- **Problem & Goal**  
  - Addresses a **deterministic VRP** (Capacitated VRP, or CVRP) with real distances from an actual road network.  
  - Seeks to improve upon classical OR-based solvers and prior deep learning (DL) approaches for large-scale VRP instances.  
  - Proposes a **graph convolutional network (GCN) model** to embed node features (coordinate, demand) and edge features (real GIS distances).

- **Key Methodology**  
  - **Encoder**: A multi-layer GCN that processes both node- and edge-level features, capturing real distances (as opposed to purely Euclidean) and demands.  
  - **Two Decoders**:
    1. **Sequential Prediction Decoder**: Uses a GRU with pointer-style attention to construct feasible routes sequentially, following a reinforcement learning (RL) objective.  
    2. **Edge Classification Decoder**: Uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on edge embeddings to produce a probability matrix indicating which edges are active in the routes.  
  - **Joint Training Strategy**:
    - The sequential decoder is trained via a **policy gradient** (REINFORCE) approach with a rollout baseline.  
    - The edge decoder is trained **supervised** by the routes (sequence) generated from the RL decoder.  
    - A combined loss (reinforcement + supervised) promotes faster convergence and higher solution quality.

- **Experiments & Results**  
  - Benchmarked on internal datasets simulating or matching real-world distribution tasks. Instances range from 20 up to 400 customers (and a special “VRP-R” set up to 300).  
  - Compared against:
    - **OR-Tools** (Google’s heuristic-based VRP solver)  
    - Other DL-based methods like **Pointer-based RL (PRL)** and **Attention Model (AM)**  
  - **Main Findings**:
    - The proposed GCN approach outperforms existing neural approaches (PRL, AM) by around 5% in solution cost, especially at larger instance sizes.  
    - Surpasses OR-Tools in solution quality, with significant time savings (near-instant inference vs. hours for OR-Tools).  
    - Joint learning of node sequences and edge activation yields stronger performance than a single-decoder approach.  
    - The model generalizes well to different problem sizes (e.g., training on smaller problems but successfully deploying to bigger ones).

- **Strengths and Contributions**  
  - **Novel GCN-based approach** capturing both node and edge features for real-world VRPs (non-Euclidean distances).  
  - **Reinforcement + Supervised Hybrid** synergy that accelerates training and improves route feasibility.  
  - Demonstrates effective large-scale deployment potential due to fast inference times and stable solution quality improvement.

- **Weaknesses / Limitations**  
  - Does not adopt standard VRP benchmark sets (e.g., no mention of known repositories like Christofides, Solomon). Thus, broader comparability is constrained.  
  - Real-world data can be specific to the studied logistics provider; generalization to other networks might need careful re-training.  
  - The edge-based classifier relies heavily on the sequential decoder’s labels; any biases in the RL solution may propagate.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP Research**  
  - Showcases a robust **GCN-based** model that uses **both** node and edge embeddings for a **capacity-constrained deterministic VRP**.  
  - Proposes a flexible neural framework that can be adapted to other VRP variants (like pick-up and delivery) with minimal changes.  
  - Illustrates how **joint supervised + RL training** can handle large real-world VRPs effectively, which is a key trend in next-generation ML-based routing.
