## Abstract
“This paper presents a Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) relocation strategy in a sharing system considering machine learning based state-of-charge (SOC) prediction model. The proposed work involves the machine learning approaches like the Adaboost algorithm and XGBoost algorithm for PEVs SOC prediction in relocation problems for the first time. Also, the low-capacity batteries of PEVs are considered as it is affordable by the common people with less charging time. It is also believed that the large number of low capacities PEVs based taxi owners in metropolitan cities will be attracted towards relocation-based sharing system considering machine learning based SOC prediction model. The customer request for sharing PEVs will be reflected in the management system at the beginning. Assuming all the PEVs with a certain level of SOC during pre-relocation are connected to the management system. The customer request for PEVs service will be assigned to the nearest PEVs depending on the predicted value of SOC by machine learning approaches. The machine learning-based predicted value of PEVs SOC will help the management system to identify the nearest PEVs for the customer sharing system. The present work steps are listed here. Firstly, the PEVs with higher predicted SOC value by machine learning have been shared with the customer from the nearest location considering descending order of their SOC. Further, the rest of the PEVs will be assigned to the nearest charging station by the PEV sharing management system. Secondly, the customer request is assigned from the station to relocate PEVs with higher SOC values in descending order. Different case studies are assumed including one practical scenario of Mumbai, India. The optimization problem of multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) with the minimization of relocation cost has been solved by IBM CPLEX optimizer in this work. Finally, the proposed work efficacy has been demonstrated with some validated results including less relocation costs for all the case studies under consideration with lower capacity based PEVs.”

## Summary
- **Context & Motivation**  
  - Addresses the challenge of relocating electric vehicles (EVs) in a sharing system (e.g., short-term rentals, taxi fleets).  
  - Considers plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with low-capacity batteries, focusing on cost-effective, user-friendly solutions suitable for large metropolitan areas.  
  - Seeks to improve the efficiency of determining which vehicles to assign to customers by predicting each vehicle’s state-of-charge (SOC).

- **ML Technique & Purpose**  
  - Proposes a supervised learning approach to predict battery SOC after a vehicle has traveled a certain distance.  
  - Uses two algorithms: Adaboost and XGBoost.  
  - Trains on travel data (initial SOC, distance/time traveled) to predict end-of-journey SOC, enabling the system to decide which vehicle can still serve an upcoming trip without risk of battery depletion.

- **VRP Variant & Core Method**  
  - Formulates a multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) under deterministic conditions: depots/stations are fixed, and the objective is to minimize the total relocation cost of assigning EVs to customers.  
  - The vehicle assignment depends on having sufficient SOC to fulfill each trip without interruption.  
  - The problem is solved with IBM CPLEX (an exact solver), guided by the predicted SOC values to filter feasible relocations.

- **Methodology**  
  - **SOC Prediction**:  
    - Adaboost & XGBoost are trained on historical or simulated data that includes trip distance, initial battery level, and final battery level.  
    - XGBoost gave slightly better accuracy metrics (lower MSE, RMSE, MAPE) compared to Adaboost.  
  - **Route Optimization**:  
    - The predicted SOC determines whether a PEV can serve a customer trip or needs recharging first.  
    - Uses a cost minimization function that depends on total distance traveled.  
    - Experiments with different numbers of PEVs, depots, and customers to measure total relocation cost and solution feasibility.

- **Experiments & Key Findings**  
  - Tested on synthetic case studies with up to 800 PEVs and 2–10 depots to examine relocation cost as the station count grows.  
  - Demonstrated a practical scenario in Mumbai, India, with 31 depots and 29 dense customer pickup locations.  
  - XGBoost-based SOC prediction improved the relocation planning, lowering cost by correctly identifying which vehicles had enough SOC.  
  - Observed that adding depots reduces relocation cost since vehicles can be stationed closer to demand centers.

- **Strengths**  
  - Novel integration of supervised machine learning (SOC prediction) with a classical exact solver (IBM CPLEX) for multi-depot routing of EVs.  
  - Demonstrates feasibility on real-world data (Mumbai scenario).  
  - Showcases a cost reduction approach by coupling SOC prediction with relocation planning in a deterministic VRP framework.

- **Limitations & Gaps**  
  - Does not use standard VRP benchmarks; performance results may not be directly comparable to classical reference instances.  
  - Considers only distance-based cost minimization, while ignoring other potential cost components (e.g., labor or capital costs).  
  - Focuses on static/deterministic approach; no dynamic or real-time updates for the route decisions.

- **Relevance to Thesis**  
  - Illustrates how supervised learning can predict an operational parameter (battery SOC) that constrains the VRP.  
  - Exemplifies a “hybrid” approach: ML for parameter estimation, plus an exact solver for final routing decisions.  
  - Contributes a multi-depot EV setting (vehicle relocation or rebalancing) under deterministic conditions.
