## Abstract
"This study focuses on the collaborative multicenter vehicle routing problem with time windows and mixed deliveries and pickups (CMVRPTWMDP), which is a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with mixed deliveries and pickups and time windows. Collaboration and transportation resource sharing are adopted to optimize vehicle routes in the CMVRPTWMDP, integrating delivery and pickup services with time windows and constructing open-closed mixed vehicle routes. A mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize logistics operating costs, considering transportation resource sharing and maintaining cost reduction. A two-stage hybrid algorithm combining an improved 3D k-means clustering algorithm (based on space-time distances and demand) and a GA-PSO heuristic algorithm is developed to reassign customers to facilities and optimize vehicle routes. A coordination operator allows particles and chromosomes to interact, enhancing diversity and solution feasibility. The performance of the proposed method is tested against CPLEX on small-scale instances, other existing algorithms on benchmark instances, and a real-world case study from Chongqing, China. A profit allocation scheme via the minimum costs-remaining savings (MCRS) mechanism is also introduced. Results show significant cost reductions and improved resource utilization. The study suggests that these collaborative approaches can effectively allocate and utilize transportation resources while optimizing local logistics networks."

## Summary
- **Problem & Objective**
  - Proposes the Collaborative Multicenter Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Mixed Deliveries and Pickups (CMVRPTWMDP).  
  - Seeks to reduce total logistics cost while serving three customer demand types (pure delivery, pure pickup, or simultaneous delivery–pickup).
  - Incorporates “open-closed” routes (vehicles may end at a different facility from where they started) and employs collaboration/resource sharing across multiple depots and pickup centers.

- **Key VRP Variant**
  - Combines aspects of:
    - Multidepot VRP with time windows (MDVRPTW)
    - Mixed deliveries and pickups (PDP)
    - Open-closed mixed routing (some vehicles do not return to origin)
    - Collaboration among depots (treated as “centers”) for resource sharing

- **ML / Algorithmic Approach**
  1. **Unsupervised Clustering**  
     - An improved 3D k-means algorithm (IDKCA) using coordinates + time windows + demand.  
     - Clusters customers into groups associated with one or more centers to reduce complexity.

  2. **Hybrid GA-PSO**  
     - Combines a Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize routes within each cluster.  
     - Uses a “coordination operator” so that top GA solutions (in chromosome form) influence PSO particles to maintain diversity and avoid local optima.

- **Methodology**
  - **Mathematical Model**:  
    - Mixed-integer programming formulation minimizes total operating cost, factoring in fuel, penalty for time-window violations, and collaboration costs.  
    - Open-closed route constraints allow flexible start and end depots.
  - **Algorithm Steps**:  
    1. Assign customers to centers (DC/PC) via improved 3D k-means.  
    2. Solve each cluster’s routing with a GA-PSO metaheuristic.  
    3. Evaluate solutions across multiple runs, comparing objective values, computation times, and feasibility.

- **Experiments & Results**
  - **Small-Scale Instances**:  
    - Compared against CPLEX solver to measure solution optimality.  
    - GA-PSO produced near-optimal or optimal solutions in a fraction of the time, especially as instance size grew.  
  - **Benchmark Instances**:  
    - Compared with other known heuristics (e.g., GA–Tabu, ILS) on 25 derived test sets.  
    - GA-PSO outperformed in cost minimization and computational efficiency.  
  - **Real-World Case** (Chongqing, China):  
    - Demonstrated significant cost savings (over 30% reduction in total cost), fewer required vehicles, and no time-window violations when resource sharing was fully activated (collaborative alliance).  
    - Emphasized that partial alliances yield moderate gains, but full collaboration among all centers obtains maximal cost reductions.

- **Profit Allocation Mechanism**
  - Addresses the question of “how to share the savings” so that each participating center is incentivized to remain in the collaboration.  
  - Proposes the Minimum Costs–Remaining Savings (MCRS) approach, showing it is closer to the core center solutions than other methods (Shapley, Weak Least Core, etc.).  
  - Ensures stable alliances by fairly distributing the cost benefits.

- **Significance & Contributions**
  - Introduces a comprehensive “collaborative alliance” structure for multicenter VRP with time windows and mixed pickup/delivery demands.  
  - Integrates 3D k-means (unsupervised ML) for cluster-first route-second approach, combined with a GA-PSO metaheuristic.  
  - Demonstrates improved cost-effectiveness in real-world applications, underscores the role of profit allocation in sustaining multi-facility collaboration.

- **Strengths & Limitations**
  - **Strengths**:  
    - Systematically coordinates deliveries/pickups under time windows with open routes.  
    - Uses an ML-based clustering approach to reduce complexity.  
    - Validated on both standard benchmarks and a real-world case.  
    - Provides a game-theoretic method for stable profit allocation.  
  - **Limitations**:  
    - Relies on k-means, which can be sensitive to initial centers and does not guarantee global optimum clustering.  
    - GA-PSO is a metaheuristic, so no formal proof of optimal solution guarantee.  
    - Model complexity may increase significantly as network size grows, though the clustering partially mitigates this.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP & ML**  
  - Operates under deterministic assumptions (fixed time windows, known demands).  
  - Incorporates unsupervised learning (3D k-means) as a cluster-first approach, followed by a heuristic (GA-PSO).  
  - Potentially relevant for logistic networks seeking cost reduction through collaboration, verifying that synergy among depots is beneficial in deterministic contexts.
